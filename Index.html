            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Hello! Welcome to my channel! My name is Yuqi, but you can also call me Yuki. I am delighted to
                have this opportunity to introduce myself and am honored to be one of the students in course CS 601. </p>
            <p> I come from China, but I currently reside in San Francisco Bay Area. I have been in U.S. for 8 years. Prior to moving to San Francisco,
                I lived in New Orleans and Houston. Professionally, I have a background in finance and accounting. I graduated from Tulane University 
                with Master of Accounting degree. I got my CPA licence two years after I graduated from Tulane. I have been working in the financial 
                industry for around seven years. I worked at Ernst & Young as an audit senior for over 2 years, and currently, I am working in a hedge 
                fund investment company as a fund accountant in San Francisco.  </p>
            <p>In addition to my professional endeavors, I also enjoy coding and learning about software development. Technology is
             changing our lives, and I am motivated to acquire more IT and software skills to enhance my work efficiency and bring 
            technology into financial field. While I appreciate back-end development, I have a preference for front-end work because it offers more interactivity. 
            My goal is to become an accountant who excels in coding and programming skills.
