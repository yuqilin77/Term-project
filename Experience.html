            <h2>My Experience on CS601</h2>
            <h3 id="experienceOn601">CS601 is coming to an end, and time flies by so fast. I have truly enjoyed this class. We had a responsible professor and our facilitator, Chris. CS601 has opened the door to frontend development for me. Compared to the abstraction of the backend, I prefer the vibrant world of frontend. In this class, we learned HTML5, CSS3, JS, DOM, Vue, JSON, web design, and layout, among other topics. It has been incredibly useful. As someone who switched majors, it's exciting to see the webpages I have created. However, I know that this is just the beginning. I hope that through more systematic learning, I can create even more elaborate webpages with interactive frontend and backend components.<br><br><br><br>Thank you!<br><br></h3>
